# Quip Thinking

**Quip Thinking** is a game based off of the popular game called Quiplash, originally made by the developers at Jackbox Games. 

The original game involves two people answering witty prompts and their friends voting on which answer they liked the most. Quip Thinking puts a new spin on the game to give users a fresh take.
