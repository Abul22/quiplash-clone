                <p>Quip Thinking is all about coming up with the funniest

                "The name of your new plumbing company"<br></br><br></br>
                You can play with anyone, no matter where they are. If you only 
                want to play with friends and family, you can generate your 
                own private room code that they can use to join your room. If your 
                friends aren't online, you can always join a public room and play 
                with some potential new friends!
